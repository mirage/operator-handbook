# Introduction

What is MirageOS? Clearly not a general purpose operating system

What is the scope and target audience of this book?

There won't be any OCaml code in this manual. We won't use a host system network stack (socket API). Our focus is on running unikernels as virtual machines.

This is by no means complete, suggestions are welcome. The initial draft is focused on the struggle with network setups that we encounter when testing unikernels.
